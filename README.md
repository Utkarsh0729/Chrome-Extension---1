# Chrome Extension: AZ Problem Tracker

## Introduction  
**AZ Problem Tracker** is a Chrome extension that helps students bookmark and manage problems on the [maang.in](https://maang.in) website. In this project I learned about Chrome extension development, covering essential concepts like manifest files, storage APIs, and content scripts.

With this extension, users can:  
- Bookmark problems for later review.  
- View and manage bookmarked problems directly from the extension.  
- Learn key development concepts while building a practical tool.
